# Conclusion

1. According to the coefficients of the regression models, the most important factor is the age of the employee.
2. Also, the second most important factor is gender of the employee. 

3. We also found out that Dairy Managers have the highest average of absenteeism by a big margin.
4. And we found that Females have a higher average of absenteeism by a small margin.


> We can conclude that the older the employee is, the more likely they are to miss work.


> We also found that [CatBoostRegressor](https://catboost.ai/en/docs/) fits the dataset best, with R2 = 0.7828, which means that our CatBoostRegressor model explains 78.28% of the variance in the absent hours.

# Recommendations

> We recommend that the company should research ways to reduce the absenteeism of older employees.

> Also, we recommend that the company should hire more young people.

> Additionally, we suggest that the company should make the workplace female-friendly, since we showed that females have a higher average of absenteeism.
